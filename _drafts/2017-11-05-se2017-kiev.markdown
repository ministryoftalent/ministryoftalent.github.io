<b>Industrial conference<b>
 
I have visited Kiev a couple years ago for a business trip. Due to long working hours, I did not have an opportunity for a proper sightseeing, so when I departing it felt like it's not "good bye" but "see you later" to Kiev!
 
Earlier this year, totally out of blue, I received an invite to perhaps the biggest IT conference in Ukraine, which I gladly accepted. SE2017 (https://se2017.indevlab.com/) happened on 28-30th October in Kiev.

The event attracted folks working in technology and IT industry along with a widely represented local startup scene. The venue, Art Platforma Kiev, is surprisingly quirky. The old factory buildings turned into creative spaces with gathering thousands of participants.

Some would start wondering, what a recruiter is supposed to do on technology conference? Those who dropped by to listen my speech were not only software developers, actually majority of the audience were people involved in building startups, running HR function and actively hiring for their companies.

I was talking about good hiring practices for companies facing phase of high growth. I talked through a couple of cases of organisation transformation based on their history of setting up values and the mission. I ended up discussing the contemporary model of sourcing function being an incremental business partner to hiring manager. I loved seeing engagement of the audience and how relevant questions were asked!

Here you can have a sneek peak to my presentation from the conference:

One of the biggest disappointments on SE2017 was that during three days long conference there were literally just three talks in English. Itâ€™s a shame, because most of the topics seemed to be super attractive, but were available for russian speakers only. To the organisers: if you like to have more international audience please plan more English talks ahead!
